### Changed

#### Patcher Scripts (Major Refactoring)

**Architecture Changes:**
- Refactored signature verification patches into dedicated functions
- Reorganized code into modular feature-specific functions
- 18+ new functions created for feature isolation

**Function Organization:**
- `apply_framework_signature_patches()`
- `apply_framework_cn_notification_fix()`
- `apply_framework_disable_secure_flag()`
- `apply_services_signature_patches()`
- `apply_services_cn_notification_fix()`
- `apply_services_disable_secure_flag()`
- `apply_miui_services_signature_patches()`
- `apply_miui_services_cn_notification_fix()`
- `apply_miui_services_disable_secure_flag()`

**Command-Line Interface:**
- Enhanced argument parsing with feature options
- Improved help text with detailed examples
- Feature selection display output
- Usage examples for all scenarios

**Patching Logic:**
- Conditional patching based on feature flags
- Smart JAR skipping when no relevant features selected
- Optimized decompilation only when necessary

**Helper Functions:**
- Added `replace_entire_method()` for complete method body replacement
- Support for class-specific method targeting
- Improved error handling and logging

**Code Statistics:**
- patcher_a15.sh: 819 lines → 1,172 lines (+353)
- patcher_a16.sh: 860 lines → 1,206 lines (+346)

### Fixed

**Method Replacement Reliability**
- Enhanced `replace_entire_method()` function
- Added optional class-specific targeting parameter
- Improved file finding with fallback mechanisms
- Better error messages showing file names
- Non-fatal warnings instead of exits
- Fixed exit code 123 error when patching WindowState in Android 16

### Performance

**Optimization Improvements:**
- Faster execution when fewer features selected
- Smart JAR skipping saves decompilation time
- Selective patching reduces unnecessary operations

### Backward Compatibility

**Maintained Full Compatibility:**
- Default behavior unchanged (signature verification applied if no features specified)
- Existing command-line usage patterns still work
- No breaking changes to any interfaces
- Existing workflows continue functioning

### Technical Details

**Code Changes:**
```
Added:
- 772 lines in patcher scripts (infrastructure)
- 124 lines in feature implementations
- 102 lines in GitHub workflows
- 185 lines in web interface
- 144 lines in Telegram bot
- 11 lines in API routes
- 2,000+ lines in documentation

Modified:
- 9 code files updated
- 5 documentation files created
```

**Commits:**
1. feat: Add feature selection system infrastructure
2. feat: Implement CN notification fix feature
3. feat: Add feature selection to GitHub Actions workflows
4. feat: Add feature selection UI to web interface
5. feat: Add interactive feature selection to Telegram bot
6. feat: Add feature flags support to API workflow trigger
7. fix: Improve replace_entire_method function reliability
